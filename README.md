## FastMICEï¼šFast Multi-view Clustering via Ensembles

This is the source code for the FastMICE algorithm, which is proposed in the following paper:

Dong Huang, Chang-Dong Wang, Jian-Huang Lai.   
Fast Multi-view Clustering via Ensembles: Towards Scalability, Superiority, and Simplicity.   
IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering, accepted, 2023.

Run "demo_1.m" to test the FastMICE algorithm. The code has been tested in Matlab R2019b on a PC with Windows 10.
